 * fixture rather than something verified by unlocking a phone. This hook is
 * only the wiring: read the preference, feed AppState in, run the prompt.
 *
 * Two things it must get right, both found by review rather than by testing:
 *
 *  - The lock decision on resume is SYNCHRONOUS, from values already in hand.
 *    Awaiting AsyncStorage first meant the receipt list painted for a few
 *    frames before the lock screen, which is the leak the feature exists to
 *    prevent. The async re-read still happens, to catch a preference the
 *    Settings screen changed, but it refines a decision rather than making it.
 *  - The preference is subscribed to, not sampled once. Turning the lock back
 *    on and immediately swiping to the app switcher used to photograph the
 *    receipt list, because this had never heard about the change.
