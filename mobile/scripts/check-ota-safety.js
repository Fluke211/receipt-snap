/*
 * Could this JS brick a binary that is already in someone's hands?
 *
 * An `eas update` reaches EVERY installed binary whose runtimeVersion matches,
 * and this app's runtimeVersion policy is `appVersion` — so every build of
 * v1.0.0 gets every update. A binary only contains the native modules that were
 * in package.json when IT was compiled. Ship JS that statically imports a module
 * an older binary lacks and that binary throws at startup, before any of its own
 * code runs.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical. Build 4 shipped with `GestureHandlerRootView`
 * imported at module scope in App.tsx and crashed on launch (D-062), and the
 * same `main` would have taken build 3 down with it — build 3 has neither
 * gesture-handler nor expo-mail-composer, both of which tonight's work imports
 * statically.
 *
 * expo-updates has a recovery pipeline for exactly this, but it needs somewhere
 * to fall back TO. A fresh install running only its embedded bundle has nothing,
 * so the crash is terminal until the user reinstalls. That is the failure this
 * check exists to prevent.
 *
 * THE RULE
 *   A native module that is not present in every live binary may never appear
 *   in a static `import`. It has to be reached through a guarded require inside
 *   a function, so the failure is a hidden control rather than a dead app —
 *   the `isRestoreAvailable()` pattern in exportShare.ts.

 *
 *  - **Wander.** A lazy `[\s\S]*?` between the keyword and `from` will happily
 *    cross blank lines, semicolons and whole statements to find one — so
 *    `export type Foo = …` two lines above an import would swallow that import
 *    and then be discarded as a type. The middle is now newline-, semicolon-
 *    and quote-free, and braces are flattened first so a multi-line
 *    `import { a, b } from 'x'` still matches.
 *  - **Read comments.** `// pulled from 'somewhere'` is not an import. Comments
 *    are stripped first; the `[^:'"\\]` guard keeps `https://…` inside a string
 *    from being mistaken for one.
 *
 * `import type` / `export type` are erased by the TypeScript transform and never
 * reach the bundle, so they are skipped — flagging them would push someone
 * toward silencing the check.
