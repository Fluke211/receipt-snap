/*
 * Does the app actually use every permission it asks for?
 *
 * A config plugin that contributes a purpose string puts a permission in the
 * shipped Info.plist whether or not any code ever asks for it. Nothing in the
 * toolchain objects: the plugin is configured, the string is written, prebuild
 * succeeds. The permission is simply never used.
 *
 * Build 4 shipped exactly that. `expo-local-authentication` and `expo-location`
 * were compiled in with hand-written purpose strings, the App Review notes
 * described an app lock and a mileage log, and no file imported either module
 * (D-066). Two earlier checks passed it, because both compared documents with
 * documents: the plist against the plugin config, then the notes against the
 * plist. All three agreed. None of them was the code.
 *
 * For an app whose entire pitch is restraint, a permission with no feature
 * behind it is the corrosive thing D-007 was written to prevent — arrived at
 * from the other direction.
 *
 * THE RULE
 *   Every permission-bearing plugin in app.json must have its module imported
 *   somewhere the app can reach. A guarded require inside a function counts:
 *   that is a real, deliberately optional feature (the isRestoreAvailable()
 *   pattern). Nothing at all does not.
 *
 *   To retire a permission, remove the plugin from app.json — and remember the
 *   binary keeps it until the next native build.
 *

/*
 * What build 4 already shipped unjustified, so CI can hold the line without
 * failing on a binary nobody can change without a native build.
 *
 * Ratchet, not an exemption — same shape as BASELINE in check-contrast.js. A
 * NEW unused permission fails the build. These three fail nothing today and
 * are a standing to-do: D-066 is the decision, and whichever way it goes this
 * list gets shorter, never longer.
 *
 * Both entries were Tyler's deliberate call (D-069), not an oversight: keeping
 * the modules compiled in is what let an app lock and GPS mileage ship over the
 * air later, with no build and no credit. The cost was a purpose string in the
 * binary until then, paid knowingly.
 *
 * **The list is empty, and D-066 is closed** (2026-09-06, D-085). It emptied
 * from both ends, which is the shape the comment above predicted:
 *
 *   expo-camera                removed in build 5. Its permission was already
 *                              justified by expo-image-picker and the document
 *                              scanner, so it was dead native weight rather
 *                              than optionality
 *   expo-local-authentication  came off 2026-09-02 by SHIPPING the feature: the
 *                              Face ID app lock is real now (D-079), so the
 *                              normal check applies to it
 *   expo-location              came off in build 7 by DROPPING the plugin. GPS
 *                              mileage is ruled out, so the optionality was
 *                              never going to be spent and the app was asking
 *                              for a person's location for nothing
 *
 * An empty baseline is the strongest state this check can be in: every
 * permission in `app.json` now has code behind it, and any new one fails.
