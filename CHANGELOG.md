### js r34 — v1.0.0 (build 6) — 2026-09-05

**The ON-DEVICE badge is tappable** (D-084). It was a green dot and one word in
the header of every screen, asserting the whole product thesis and offering no
way to ask what it means. Tapping it now gives the claim in full: what happens
on the device, that there is no account and no ads or trackers, and that the
only way anything leaves is an export the user performs themselves.

**And that is what made the capture screen fit.** Tyler reported r33 as fitting
an iPhone 14 "but barely", with the privacy card's bottom edge under the tab
bar. Its second sentence, "No account, no ads, no tracking", was what wrapped it
to two lines; it moved into the badge popup, taking 21 points of line height
with it, plus 3 more from the card's margin and padding. The first sentence
stays on the screen, because a first-run user reads that and may never tap a
badge, and it is styled as the statement it is rather than as a footnote.

### js r33 — v1.0.0 (build 6) — 2026-09-04 · published 2026-09-05, group `27cf5272`

Tyler's third pass, on two things at once: the text is still too small, and
light mode is washed out.

**The type scale goes up again** (D-082), to a different bar than last time:
"easy to see and read for someone without young eyes". Nothing on screen is
under 13pt now, and `body` 16 / `lg` 17 put the app's reading sizes at iOS's own
default rather than below it.

| | r31 | r32 | r33 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `xs` overlines, tab labels, badges | 10, 10.5, 11 | 12 | 13 |
| `sm` notes, hints, list metadata | 11.5, 12 | 13 | 14 |
| `md` secondary body | 12.5, 13 | 14 | 15 |
| `body` rows, controls, form labels | 13.5, 14 | 15 | 16 |
| `lg` primary buttons, picker rows | 16 | 16 | 17 |

Headings moved with it, since "across the board" included them: the brand mark
20 -> 22, the capture hero and the Summary totals 22 -> 24, sheet titles 19/20,
the paywall and lock screen 28. The crash screen's hand-kept sizes went up in
step. The capture hero's padding drops 56 -> 40 to pay for the roughly 20 points
the raise costs that page, which has to fit an iPhone 14 without scrolling.

**Light mode is rebuilt around its surfaces** (D-083). `card` `#ffffff` on `bg`
`#f6f7f9` measured **1.07:1**, a card visible only because of a 10% hairline,
which is what "washed out" was describing. The ground drops to `#e9edf5`, the
inset surface to `#eaeef7`, and the hairline to 14%.

**And the accent comes back into it.** Dark mode gets brand presence for free,
because `card2` and `accentSoft` both read as blue against near-black; in light
both were near-white and the accent survived in about four places. `accentSoft`
doubles to 0.16 and `accentLine` to 0.45, so chips and selected states are blue
again; each export format gets its own accent icon; the photo-library button's
icon turns accent; and the ON-DEVICE badge is filled rather than an empty
outline. `muted2` darkens a third time, to `#5e6879`, to hold AA on the deeper
ground. Dark mode is untouched.

**The check that would have caught it now exists.** Every row in
`check-contrast.js` measured text against a ground; nothing measured ground
against ground, so 1.07:1 between the app's two most-used surfaces passed
everything and shipped. `SURFACES` measures it, the old light palette fails it,
and the floors are set where the dark palette actually sits.

### js r32 — v1.0.0 (build 6) — 2026-09-03

Tyler's second pass on r31: the small text is hard to read.

**A type scale** (D-080). The app had nine distinct sizes below 15pt, most of
them an accident rather than a decision, so "make the small text bigger" meant
editing 58 sizes across 10 files. The palette carries `T.fs` now, with `T.lh`
for leading beside it, and every step went up:

| | was | now |
|---|---|---|
| `xs` overlines, tab labels, badges | 10, 10.5, 11 | 12 |
| `sm` notes, hints, list metadata | 11.5, 12 | 13 |
| `md` secondary body | 12.5, 13 | 14 |
| `body` rows, controls, form labels | 13.5, 14 | 15 |

Line heights moved with the sizes and into the scale with them; headings and
amounts are untouched. `npm run test:type` fails on a literal `fontSize` below
17pt, so the residue cannot grow back. The capture screen's privacy card gives
back six points, which does not cover the dozen-odd the bigger text costs: that
page has to keep fitting an iPhone 14, and whether it does is for Tyler to say.

**Light mode's hint text was below AA** and is fixed in the same pass: `muted2`
measured 3.3:1 at 12 and 13 points, where the bar is 4.5. The light greys darken
(`muted` 5.5 -> 7.0, `muted2` 3.3 -> 4.8), the contrast check stops holding hint
text to the large-text tier, and it now measures the gaps BETWEEN the text tiers
too, and their direction: a symmetric ratio cannot tell a healthy gap from an
inverted hierarchy.

**One regression caught in review before it shipped.** Darkening the light greys
took the full-screen zoom hint from 5.96:1 to 4.07:1, because it sits on a
hardcoded black backdrop rather than a palette ground, so no pairing in the
check could see it. It takes a fixed grey now, and the check carries that
pairing.

**Brighter greys, second pass** (D-080): `muted` 7.9:1 -> 10.1:1 and `muted2`
5.1:1 -> 7.6:1 against the app background. The hierarchy still reads: 16.5,
10.1, 7.6.

**The appearance switch works on build 6** (D-081): tapping Light turns the app
light, over the air, on a binary whose plist still pins dark. **The window
override itself is still unverified**, and this entry first claimed otherwise:
the palette swap is pure JS and would look identical either way. The test is a
system alert while Light is selected. "System" is still dark until build 7.

### js r31 — v1.0.0 (build 6) — 2026-09-02

**A Face ID app lock, on by default** (D-079). `expo-local-authentication` has
been compiled into every build since build 3 with a purpose string describing a
feature that did not exist. This is the feature.

- Off is one tap away in Settings, under PRIVACY
- **Never locks a phone that cannot unlock**: availability is "a biometric or a
  passcode is enrolled", and the passcode fallback stays enabled. A privacy
  feature that shuts the owner out of their own receipts is not one
- 60-second grace period, so a trip to the share sheet or the camera does not
  demand a scan on the way back
- Nothing of the app renders while locked, or before the preference is read,
  and the app switcher's snapshot is covered: iOS photographs the screen when
  the app resigns active, and that photograph is visible without unlocking
- Rules in `src/lib/appLock.js`, pure and unit-tested, 7 new cases

**Appearance: System, Light or Dark** (D-077), in Settings. **System is dark
until the next native build**, because `app.json` pinned `userInterfaceStyle` to
dark and that is a plist fact no OTA can change; the value is now `automatic`,
ready for build 7, and the Settings copy says so until then. Light and Dark are
window-level overrides and are *expected* to work on build 6, which is reasoning
rather than a device observation. `Appearance.setColorScheme()` moves the system
surfaces too, so a light-mode app does not raise black alert dialogs.

**Brighter greys in dark mode** (D-078), Tyler reads in low light: `muted`
6.5:1 -> 7.9:1, `muted2` 3.3:1 -> 5.1:1 against the app background. One of the
five ratios baselined below the WCAG target now clears it outright and comes off
the baseline. Four remain.

**The developer unlock says nothing before it fires.** It used to count down
from the fourth tap, which tells someone who tapped the version stamp by
accident that there is something here to find.

### js r30 — v1.0.0 (build 6) — 2026-09-02

**Live on `production` since 2026-09-02** (group `859ae2fc`), runtime version
1.0.0. Published, not yet observed on a device (D-062 rule 2).

**Receipt photographs are back.** They were never gone: iOS relocated the app's
Data container between build 5 and build 6, and every row held an absolute path
under the old container UUID, so the Receipts tab was looking for the images at
last week's address (D-075).

- Paths are stored relative (`receipts/x.jpg`) and resolved against
  `documentDirectory` at the moment of use
- **Existing receipts render again on the first launch of r30.** `resolveImage()`
  repairs a stale path in place, so nothing has to migrate first. The row
  rewrite is deliberately held back: build 6 embeds r28, which cannot read the
  new form, and an OTA can break an older bundle through the database as easily
  as through an import
- `deleteReceiptFiles` and the feedback attachments resolve too. Deleting a
  stale path would have left the real photograph on the device while reporting
  it deleted; the feedback composer would have sent scan reports with no
  pictures while saying it attached them
- `src/lib/paths.js` is pure and unit-tested, 12 new cases. A path outside the
  receipts directory is refused rather than relocated
- `npm run test:paths` fails on a stored path handed straight to `<Image>` or
  FileSystem. Both forms are `string`, so TypeScript cannot see it

**No em or en dashes in user-facing text** (D-076), Tyler's rule. Sentences take
a full stop or a comma; a label and its value take `·`. Every user-facing
sentence in the app was swept, along with the copy blocks in
`docs/APP_STORE_LISTING.md`, which are pasted verbatim into App Store Connect. The IRS Schedule C line labels keep theirs, structurally:
they are a data table and they flow into every export. `npm run test:prose`
enforces it in CI, including the iOS permission prompts in `app.json`, which are
read aloud by the system permission alert. A list item keeps its dash, which is
the case the rule allows.

Capture screen:

- The privacy line at the bottom is two lines now, not three, so the page fits
  an iPhone 14 without scrolling. It says what the hero does not: no account,
  no ads, no tracking

### js r29 — v1.0.0 (build 6) — 2026-09-02

**Live on `production` since 2026-09-02** (group `d2679345`), runtime version
1.0.0, so every live binary receives it. **Not yet observed on a device** —
D-062 rule 2 — until the Summary footer reads `js r29`.

Capture screen, from Tyler's notes on build 6:

- **Recent list is 3 rows**, not 4 (`RECENT_ROWS` in `CaptureScreen.tsx`). This
  screen is for scanning; the Receipts tab is where a list belongs
- **"Choose from photo library" is a button now.** As plain text under a big
  dashed rectangle it did not read as tappable. Filled inset, hairline border,
  photo icon, pressed state — obviously pressable, still clearly secondary to
  the hero

Startup net (D-074) — now permanent, so rewritten for someone who is not Tyler:

- **Non-fatal errors no longer take over the screen.** The `ErrorUtils` handler
  raised the full-screen report for soft exceptions too, so any library
  reporting one could replace a healthy app — and lose an unsaved scan sitting
  in the review form. Fatals only
- Plain headline, the support address inline, and the stack trace behind **Show
  technical details**; `when` and the version stay visible, because a
  screenshot without them is the report that cost four days
- The stamp carries **no build number**: `APP_BUILD` is a JS constant that an
  OTA pushes to every binary, so it would have told a build-5 phone it was
  build 6. Read through a guarded require, like everything else in that file
- Follows the system light/dark setting, with its own two palettes — the theme
  module is app code, and app code is what just failed. `npm run test:contrast`
  reads that literal now, so its ratios are checked rather than asserted
- **"Check for an update" button.** Rendering a fatal instead of re-throwing
  gives up expo-updates' automatic rollback, so the recovery is offered as a tap
  — check, fetch, restart — rather than quietly lost (D-074)

Guards:

- Build 6 added to `LIVE_BUILDS` — observed to launch on device
- `check-ota-safety.js` had three holes. It scanned `index.ts`, renamed to
  `index.tsx` in D-071, so **the entry point was the file it skipped** — it
  walks the project and names its exclusions now. `PURE_JS` claimed `expo` and
  `@expo/vector-icons` ship no native code, which would have waved through the
  exact import that caused D-072 — both are listed per build instead, verified
  against each build's own `package.json`. And `export … from 'pkg'` was
  invisible to it
- The scanner is regex-free of the two ways that widening goes wrong: it cannot
  wander across lines (an `export type` above an import used to **swallow that
  import**) and it cannot read a comment as an import. Four probe cases run
  against the real script

Capture flow:

- **One scan at a time.** `startScan` awaits the Pro check, the paywall and the
  picker before `busy` hides the controls, so the newly prominent upload button
  could be double-tapped into two pickers or two paywalls

### v1.0.0 (build 6) — 2026-09-02

**The first binary that launches on its own.** Confirmed on Tyler's device: the
footer reads `js r28` and the icons are real Ionicons, so the `overrides` pin
did what D-072 said it would — autolinking compiles expo-font at the SDK 55
major, `ExpoFontLoader` registers, and `@expo/vector-icons` imports cleanly.

Builds 4 and 5 only became usable after fetching an OTA, which a fresh install
never got far enough to do. Build 6's **embedded** bundle (js r28) runs, so this
is the first submittable binary.

- Built from `4676b73` after the first attempt died on a CocoaPods CDN 400
  (D-073) — infrastructure, not the diff
- No module changes from build 5; the only difference is the lockfile pin

### v1.0.0 (build 5) — 2026-08-31

**The build that makes the app launch again.** Build 4's embedded bundle was
js r22, which aborts on evaluation, and an OTA cannot rescue a binary that
never gets far enough to apply one (D-067). Build 5 embeds js r26.

- `expo-camera` removed — its camera permission was already earned by
  expo-image-picker and the document scanner, so it bought nothing (D-069)
- `expo-local-authentication` and `expo-location` deliberately kept, so a Face
  ID app lock and GPS mileage can ship over the air later with no build

**Built and submitted to TestFlight 2026-08-31** — EAS build `eb6ad3c5`, real
`.ipa`, uploaded and accepted by App Store Connect. **Not yet observed to
launch**, so this is *built*, not shipped (D-062 rule 2), and build 5 is
deliberately absent from `LIVE_BUILDS` until a device has run it.

### js r28 — v1.0.0 (build 5) — 2026-08-31

**Confirmed running on device 2026-08-31.** The first JS revision since r21 that
a phone has actually executed — r22 through r27 were all published without one.
Build 5 is now in `LIVE_BUILDS` (D-062 rule 2).

Two things this does NOT mean:

- **Build 5 is not submittable.** Its embedded bundle is js r26, which still
  carries the unguarded Ionicons import and still dies on `ExpoFontLoader`. It
  only runs because it fetched r28 afterwards, so a *fresh* install still
  crashes on first launch.
- **The binary is not fixed.** It still links expo-font 57.0.1. r28 works
  around that; the `overrides` pin needs build 6.

**The launch crash, found and worked around.** r27's diagnostic reported it on
the first launch: `Cannot find native module 'ExpoFontLoader'` (D-072).

- `@expo/vector-icons` pulls in `expo-font`, and npm hoisted **57.0.1** to the
  top level while `expo` pins 55.0.8 nested. Autolinking compiles the hoisted
  copy, so builds 4 and 5 carried expo-font 57's native code built against
  expo-modules-core 55. It never registered, and the throw happened during
  module evaluation — before any screen could render
- **Icons now degrade instead of crashing.** `Icon.tsx` reaches Ionicons through
  a guarded require and falls back to text glyphs. Self-healing: real icons
  return by themselves once a binary has a working font module, with nothing to
  revert
- `overrides` pins expo-font to 55.0.8 — the real fix, and it **needs build 6**
- `check-expo-pins.js` now fails on any autolinked native package installed at
  two versions, and its allowance list is empty. That list is what hid this:
  it claimed the SDK linked the nested copy, which is backwards

### js r27 — v1.0.0 (build 5) — 2026-08-31 — DIAGNOSTIC

**Not a feature release.** Build 5 crashes on launch exactly as build 4 did, so
D-062 and D-067 are both wrong (D-070). The crash log proves a JavaScript error
was thrown and that expo-updates aborted the process — which destroys the error
text. Nobody has ever read it.

r27 is r26 plus a net that renders the error instead: a try/catch around the
App require, an error boundary, and an `ErrorUtils` global handler for the async
case the evidence actually points at. It comes out as soon as the fault is
known (D-071).

### js r26 — v1.0.0 (build 5) — 2026-08-31

**Live on `production` since 2026-08-31** (group `4c48a54a`), published after
build 5 was built rather than before, so the channel head and the binary's own
embedded bundle are the same JS. Publishing it earlier would have helped
nobody: build 4 cannot launch far enough to apply an update (D-067).

- **Capture screen rebuilt to Tyler's pick** — concept A with concept C's
  recent list (D-069). One big dashed tap target and no second "Scan Receipt"
  button, a free-tier scan meter, and a compressed Recent list under the photo
  library link. Tapping a recent row opens that receipt
- **Moving trucks now file to Schedule C line 20a** (D-068). U-Haul, Penske,
  Ryder and Budget Truck were not "landing in Travel" as the roadmap assumed —
  they were landing on **Insurance** and **Office Supplies**, on the words
  "coverage" and "box". Every brand keyword is scoped to the rental arm,
  because U-Haul self-storage is line 20b and Penske Automotive is a car
  dealership
- The scan meter is free-tier only and its bar fills as the month is spent, so
  the exhausted state has a bar to colour; `exhausted` delegates to the same
  function the paywall uses rather than restating the boundary
- Recents sort by scan time, not by the user-editable receipt date

### js r25 — v1.0.0 (build 4) — 2026-08-30

**Live on `production` since 2026-08-30**, verified at the head of the branch
rather than assumed from a green workflow. It reaches installs that already
exist; a *fresh* install still runs build 4's embedded r22 and crashes until
build 5 (D-067).

- **Costco receipts now name Costco** (D-065), which r24 recorded as
  deliberately unresolved. That call was right about the evidence available at
  the time and wrong about where to look: a Costco receipt prints the warehouse
  location ("Hawaii Kai #120"), never the word Costco, so there is no name for
  OCR to recover and no domain to fall back on. Both corpus dumps were landing
  in the receipt list as "Bw Yai Grup" and "Howat Kai 1"
- The merchant now comes from the receipt's own vocabulary when nothing else
  yields one — `whse:`/`Trm:` fields, "TOTAL NUMBER OF ITEMS SOLD", "INSTANT
  SAVINGS" — and **two** of them must match. One is not enough, and the corpus
  proves it: Safeway prints "TOTAL NUMBER OF ITEMS SOLD" as well, so a
  single-marker threshold would have renamed every Safeway receipt Costco.
  That guard is now a test
- Naming the merchant also settles the category, because "costco" was already a
  General Merchandise keyword. The real corpus goes from 4 clean receipts of 9
  to 6. The three still flagged are Bass Pro and Cabela's, whose merchants read
  correctly and whose category is genuinely the user's call

### js r24 — v1.0.0 (build 4) — 2026-08-30

- **Merchants are read from the shop's own domain** when the header does not
  yield one (D-063). Scoring the real corpus showed the merchant, not the
  categorizer, was the broken field: Cabela's parsed as "All Ammo And Firearm
  Sales Are Final", Target as its street address and phone number, Safeway as
  "Safeway €).". That string is what a CPA reads on the export, and what
  merchant memory keys off
- The **earliest** marker wins, so the second receipt appended to the Target
  scan cannot rename it Cabela's
- Costco is deliberately still unresolved — OCR mangles the name and the domain
  appears nowhere, so there is nothing to match. Correct it once and merchant
  memory recognizes the store thereafter

### js r23 — v1.0.0 (build 4) — 2026-08-30

**Fixes the build 4 launch crash.** Shipped over the air; no new build.

- **Build 4 crashed on every launch** on its embedded r22 bundle (D-062).
  `GestureHandlerRootView` was imported at module scope to pre-wire
  swipe-to-delete, and that import drags Reanimated's whole runtime in.
  Removing it takes the bundle from 1178 modules to 752
- **`expo-mail-composer` moved behind a guarded require.** It was statically
  imported, which would have crashed build 3 — the only working fallback — the
  moment an update reached it
- **Swipe-to-delete held back** until a build has been observed to launch with
  gesture-handler in it
- New `npm run test:ota` fails CI on any static import of a native module a
  live binary was not compiled with

Everything below shipped in the same update — the overnight feature work, minus
swipe-to-delete.

- **Settings tab** (D-058). Subscription, restore-from-archive, about, developer
  options and a danger zone. Manage Subscription moved out of the EXPORT card,
  where it sat between "Full JSON backup" and a note about QuickBooks date
  formats and could not be found
- **Restore Purchases** — there was none outside the fallback paywall, which
  only appears when RevenueCat's remote template fails to load. Apple requires
  one (Guideline 3.1.1)
- **Delete all data**, behind two confirmations, removing the receipt
  photographs as well as the rows
- **Export date ranges** (D-056): All / This year / any year with receipts.
  Filenames now carry both the coverage and the export date —
  `taxtrail-2025-exported-2026-08-30.csv`. Exporting twice no longer produces
  two files with the same name
- **An info control on every export format**, explaining what it is for and
  which one to send an accountant
- **`edited` in parser diagnostics** (D-057), derived from a frozen snapshot of
  the classifier's output. A correction now exports as `parserSaid` next to
  `stored`, which is a labelled fixture rather than an anecdote
- Developer-only exports (JSON backup, parser diagnostics) moved behind seven
  taps on the version stamp
- ~~Swipe a receipt left to delete it~~ (D-060) — **written but held back.** It
  needs gesture-handler, which is what crashed build 4; it ships with build 5,
  once a binary has been observed to launch with that module in it
- **Send feedback** (D-059), from Settings or from a specific receipt. Attaches
  only what you tick, and sends through the Mail app so you see your own
  address and every attachment before it goes. Checked against Apple's
  optional-disclosure criteria: this is what keeps the **Data Not Collected**
  label true, and an in-app upload would not have
- **Fixed: a custom export range would have crashed the XLSX export.** SheetJS
  throws on a worksheet name over 31 characters and `Summary <range>` exceeded it
- **Fixed: year filtering by `Date` put New Year's Day in the previous year** for
  every US timezone. Ranges compare ISO strings; the suite runs under four
  timezones
- **Light theme** (D-061), following the iOS system setting. No in-app toggle —
  iOS already has that switch and it is where people look for it
- **Fixed: the fallback paywall's title was hardcoded `#fff`**, which is
  invisible on a light background. Found by the new contrast check, not by eye
- **Fixed: two danger-red borders were hardcoded** to the dark palette's red
- New `npm run test:contrast` computes WCAG contrast from the palette itself and
  ratchets against a baseline, so a colour change cannot quietly make something
  unreadable

### Build 4 — v1.0.0 (build 4) · js r22 — 2026-08-29

**Built and submitted to TestFlight 2026-08-30** — build ID
`b8ebc4af-5092-4351-9a07-8380a829f7f5`. Took three submissions: the first died in
`Install pods` on the worklets pin (D-054), the second on an Expo-side
`SERVER_ERROR` that never reached a worker (D-055).


First native build since 26 August, cut so the submitted binary does not embed
stale JS and so the native surface for pending work is compiled in (D-053).

- Adds `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-reanimated` and
  `expo-mail-composer`. All New Architecture compatible (`codegenConfig`
  present), versions taken from `expo/bundledNativeModules.json`
- `GestureHandlerRootView` wired as the outermost view, so swipe-to-delete can
  ship over the air afterwards
- No `babel.config.js` added: `babel-preset-expo` already adds the worklets
  plugin automatically when the package is installed

### OTA — v1.0.0 (build 3) · js r21 — 2026-08-29

- **Editing a receipt's total or sales tax could not accept a decimal point.**
  The fields were bound straight to a number, so each keystroke round-tripped
  through `parseFloat` and erased anything not yet a finished number — typing
  `0.40` recorded **$40.00**, a factor of 100, silently. Both fields now keep
  the raw text while focused (D-052)

### OTA — v1.0.0 (build 3) · js r20 — 2026-08-29

Three parser bugs from the first real diagnostics export. All three were
invisible to the synthetic corpus, which sat at 100% throughout (D-051).

- **A receipt that stacks labels then values had its total read as the
  subtotal.** A real Target receipt exported $1.50 light, silently. Repaired
  only when subtotal + tax appears verbatim on the receipt, so a genuinely
  tax-inclusive receipt is untouched
- **A restaurant coupon in the footer filed a fishing-bait receipt as a
  50%-deductible business meal.** A category whose entire case rests on the
  promotional footer no longer qualifies
- **A Home Depot receipt that never prints "Home Depot"** — only the slogan
  "How doers get more done." — is now recognized from the slogan
- Four real receipts added to `__tests__/corpus/`

### OTA — v1.0.0 (build 3) · js r19 — 2026-08-29

- **"Manage subscription" in the Summary export card**, shown only to
  subscribers. Opens the App Store's own sheet via
  `Purchases.showManageSubscriptions()`.

  Found while testing: Apple gives no way to cancel a subscription bought
  through TestFlight with a real Apple Account. Settings → Subscriptions does
  not list it, and App Store Connect's "Clear Purchase History" only works on
  sandbox testers — the only other exit is waiting out six accelerated
  renewals. It is also the right thing to ship: a subscriber who cannot find
  the cancel button asks for a refund instead of finding it

### OTA — v1.0.0 (build 3) · js r18 — 2026-08-29

- **"Meals & Entertainment" is now "Business Meals"** (D-050). Entertainment
  has been nondeductible since the TCJA and the Schedule C instructions say
  twice not to put it on that line, so the old name invited scanning an
  entertainment receipt into a 50%-deductible bucket. The label now matches the
  form's own wording: "Line 24b — Deductible meals (50%)"
- **Existing receipts are migrated.** There was no migration mechanism at all
  before this; added a `PRAGMA user_version` runner. The rename rewrites the
  category on every row and inside every allocation, and refreshes the stored
  Schedule C label
- **Archives exported before the rename still import correctly.** Restore maps
  old category names through the same alias table, so an old backup lands under
  the new name instead of resurrecting a category with no TXF code
- **New category: Equipment Rental → Schedule C line 20a**, TXF refnum 299.
  The line-coverage audit found it was the only uncovered Part II line that is
  actually receipt-shaped — renting a lift or a trencher produces a receipt.
  Office and storage rent stay on 20b; rental cars stay in Travel (24a)

### OTA — v1.0.0 (build 3) · js r17 — 2026-08-29

The pre-launch correctness batch. Everything below shipped in this revision.

### Exports — 2026-08-29

Audit of every package-specific export against its spec (D-046). Five real
defects; the one with the most at stake turned out to be already correct.

- **TXF sign convention was already right** — negative for expenses is what
  v042 requires. Verified against four independent copies of the spec
- **Refnum 302 is Record Format 3.** Each "other business expense" category now
  gets its own record with a `P` description and its own `L`, instead of five
  categories merged into one record with their names in an `X` line. `X` is a
  detail-record field with a columnar layout, so the old output put a category
  name where an importer expects a date — and lost the Part V itemization
- **Two categories mapped to the wrong refnum.** Postage → 313 (line 18, per
  "office supplies and postage"), Employee Benefits → 308 (line 14). The
  second meant the exported file contradicted the app's own category label
- **Schedule C "Other expenses" is line 27b, not 27a**, for tax year 2025 — the
  IRS swapped it with the Form 7205 deduction. Four labels were stale
- TXF header date is zero-padded (`D08/01/2026`), and the `A` record now
  carries the app version, as the spec's definition of that field requires
- **QuickBooks CSV no longer starts with a BOM.** It is machine-read by QBO's
  importer, where a BOM can only be read as part of the first header name; the
  CPA CSV keeps its BOM because that one gets opened in Excel
- Renamed to **QuickBooks Online** — Desktop cannot import bank transactions
  from CSV at all, so the generic name pointed Desktop users at a dead end
- The export screen now warns to set the date format at QuickBooks' mapping
  step. It defaults to day-first, which files anything before the 13th of a
  month in the wrong month **with no error at all**

### Parser — 2026-08-29

- **Amounts whose decimal point Vision read as a space are recovered.**
  `1. 49` and `$140. 35` (both verbatim from the Costco dump in the corpus)
  matched nothing at all before, so the receipt fell through to a
  largest-number guess. On the synthetic corpus the total was recovered on
  12.6% of receipts carrying this artifact; now 100%. Added as a fallback that
  runs only when the strict pattern finds nothing, so no line that already
  parsed can change meaning (D-045)
- `extractTotal` now shares the money scanner with everything else. It was
  still calling the raw regex, which meant it never picked up the
  "a printed rate is not an amount" guard added in r16
- Synthetic corpus grew two axes taken from the real corpus — the spaced
  decimal above, and a smudge fused onto the label (`wx TOTAL`). The second
  was already handled correctly; it is pinned so it stays that way
- CI now runs `test:synth` on every PR

### Receipt splitting — 2026-08-29

- **A split could exceed the receipt, and the screen hid it.** Nothing capped
  the running total, so a $50 receipt split into two $30 parts saved a **-$10**
  allocation — while the remainder hint clamped itself to "$0.00" and reported
  the split as balanced. Splits are now capped, and the hint shows the real
  remainder (D-049)
- **The TXF file could contain a malformed amount.** A negative category total
  concatenated into `$--10.00`, which an importer cannot read. The amount is
  now negated rather than prefixed, so a category netting to a credit reads as
  a positive number on the expense line — which is also what the spec's `Sgn=E`
  convention calls for

### Exports — sales tax (2026-08-29)

- **Splitting a receipt no longer loses or invents cents of sales tax.** Each
  part was rounded on its own, so $1.00 of tax across three categories
  exported as $0.99 and $0.01 across two exported as $0.02. Sales tax feeds
  Schedule A line 5a, so the invented cent was an over-claim. Now
  largest-remainder in whole cents (D-048)
- The Summary screen uses the same split, so summing the CSV's "Sales Tax
  Portion" column gives exactly the figure the app displays
- **Excel money columns are formatted as money.** Amounts were written as bare
  numbers, so a column read 10, 1, 2.5 instead of 10.00, 1.00, 2.50 — harder
  to scan in the one export built for a human to read down. The "Entries"
  count is deliberately left as an integer

### Repository — 2026-08-29

- **Workflow inputs no longer reach the shell.** `${{ inputs.* }}` was written
  inline in four steps, so GitHub substituted the text before bash parsed it: an
  update message containing `$1000` became a shell expansion and killed the r16
  publish under `set -u`. Beyond the breakage, that shape lets arbitrary input
  run commands in a job holding `EXPO_TOKEN` and an Apple signing key. All four
  now pass through `env:`

### OTA — v1.0.0 (build 3) · js r16 — 2026-08-29

Two parser fixes, both found by the new synthetic corpus (D-041), both
affecting real receipts:

- **A printed tax rate is no longer read as the tax.** `TAX 8.25%  3.71`
  returned `8.25`. US receipts print the rate on the tax line constantly
- **Amounts over $999 no longer lose their leading digits.** `1124.06` parsed
  as `124.06`, and `12345.67` as `345.67` — a $12,345 purchase recorded as
  $345, with no error anywhere. This is the more serious of the two
- **Tips now count toward the total** (D-042). A card slip prints the pre-tip
  figure as "AMOUNT CHARGED" and the real amount lower down, so every tipped
  meal was under-deducted. Added only when the receipt prints the post-tip
  figure — a total that already includes the tip is not double-counted, a
  suggested-tip guide is not a charge, and a handwritten tip leaves the total
  alone. Over-reporting a deduction is the worse failure, so the rule only
  moves in the direction the receipt confirms
- `npm run test:synth` — thousands of generated receipts with exact ground
  truth, scored per format against a committed baseline. 35 unit tests, up
  from 23

### OTA — v1.0.0 (build 3) · js r13 — 2026-08-26

- **Tab bar uses Ionicons instead of emoji**, outline when inactive and solid
  when selected — the iOS idiom, and something emoji cannot express, which was
  most of why the old bar read as placeholder art
- Ships over the air: `expo-font` is already autolinked through `expo` itself,
  so `FontLoaderModule` is compiled into build 3, and the `.ttf` is a static
  `import` that Metro treats as an asset. No build required
- `@expo/vector-icons` promoted to a direct dependency. It was only reachable
  at `expo/node_modules/@expo/vector-icons`, so importing it directly would
  have failed to resolve at runtime, not just in `tsc`

### Repository — 2026-08-27

- `step: asc-iap` in the EAS workflow — reports the App Store Connect state of
  every in-app purchase product. StoreKit only hands a product to the app once
  App Store Connect considers it complete, so an empty paywall is usually a
  product-state problem wearing the costume of a code problem. Read-only, free

### Repository — 2026-08-26

- **CI on pull requests** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — unit tests, `tsc`, and
  a check that `APP_BUILD`/`APP_VERSION` agree with `app.json`. Tests previously
  ran only when someone remembered to dispatch the EAS workflow, so nothing was
  verified at the moment a PR merged. The version check is aimed squarely at the
  D-039 drift and was negative-tested in both directions
- Pre-launch checklist added to `ROADMAP.md`

### v1.0.0 (build 3) · js r12 — 2026-08-26

Everything staged since build 2, in one build. Tyler lifted the build-rationing
constraint (end of the EAS billing month), so the batch shipped as a single
production build rather than waiting further.

Build `43156c07-a964-4a6c-b8a1-ae38d92586ea`, submission
`d680e7f6-f407-4e79-a458-c46c47b35335`. Credentials reused unchanged, so
`expo-document-picker` cost no credential regeneration (D-011 does not apply).

- **App header now reads TaxTrail.** Last user-visible instance of the old name;
  it survived two rename sweeps as `Receipt<Text>Snap</Text>`, split across JSX
  nodes (D-040)
- **New app icon** — a receipt cut at both ends, shallow teeth, generated from
  `mobile/scripts/make-icons.py` (D-038)
- **`taxtrail://capture` deep link** opens straight into the scanner (D-024),
  which is what makes a Control Centre / Lock Screen / Action Button shortcut
  worth setting up. Verified in the generated `Info.plist`: `CFBundleURLTypes`
  carries `taxtrail`, permissions unchanged at five, entitlements still empty
- **Restore from a receipt archive** (`expo-document-picker`) — closes the loop
  D-016 opened. The archive export has existed since js r3 with nothing able to
  read it back, which makes it a backup in name only. Re-importing the same
  archive is a no-op: rows are fingerprinted on merchant + date + total, and
  duplicates within one archive collapse too. A row whose image is missing still
  imports — the data is the tax record, the photo is the substantiation
- Restore is **hidden** unless `expo-document-picker` is present, since JS ships
  over the air and can land on a binary compiled without the native module
- `mobile/src/lib/restorePlan.js` — the pure half, with 8 tests. 18/18 green
- **Build numbers now live in git** (D-039). `autoIncrement` is off, and a free
  App Store Connect read fails the workflow before `eas build` spends quota if
  the number is already taken. Its first run confirmed the diagnosis outright —
  Apple reported `['2']` as the only number on file for 1.0.0, which is exactly
  what `autoIncrement` would have produced again
- `step: update` can target a channel (it hardcoded `development`, so it could
  never reach TestFlight); it now prints the target binary and version stamp
  before publishing

### OTA — v1.0.0 (build 2) · js r12 — 2026-08-26

Published to the **`production`** channel, so it reached the TestFlight build
without a native build. Update group `2cb556d9-e656-4109-aae9-eeeadc5066ba`,
runtime `1.0.0`, from commit `4de5450`.

- Carries the **TaxTrail header fix** to build 2, which had been showing
  *ReceiptSnap* since 2026-08-21 (D-040)
- Deliberately published **before** the build-number bump landed, so the bundle
  still carries `APP_BUILD = 2` and build 2 reports itself correctly. The deep
  link is inert there (no URL scheme in that binary) and the Restore card stays
  hidden (`isRestoreAvailable()` finds no `expo-document-picker`)
- Required fixing `step: update`, which hardcoded `--branch development` and so
  could never reach TestFlight at all

### v1.0.0 (build 2) · js r11 — 2026-08-21

First build under the TaxTrail identity, and the first App Store distribution
build. Submitted to TestFlight (submission `833b2322…`).

- Bundle identifier `com.tylerthornbrue.taxtrail`, distribution certificate and
  provisioning profile created (D-037)
- **The footer on this build reads `build 1`** — `autoIncrement` bumped the
  number on the runner without committing it, so the repo and the binary
  disagreed. Fixed in the entry below (D-039)
- **The header on this build reads `ReceiptSnap`** — the rename missed it, and
  the PR that claimed to fix it shipped no app changes at all (D-040)

### v1.0.0 (build 1) · js r11 — 2026-08-12

- **Privacy link now points at `taxtrail.app`**, and so do both App Store URLs.
  Only made after the live site returned 200 five consecutive times per page
  (D-033) — a fresh Cloudflare Pages custom domain serves 522s for the first
  couple of minutes, and acting on the first success would have shipped a
  broken Guideline 3.1.2 link for the second time.

### v1.0.0 (build 1) · js r10 — 2026-08-10

- **Fixed a broken privacy link in the paywall.** The repo rename to `TaxTrail`
  moved the GitHub Pages path, so `FallbackPaywall`'s `PRIVACY_URL` was pointing
  at a URL that now returns 404 — verified. Guideline 3.1.2 requires a working
  privacy link on the purchase screen, so this would have failed review.
- Support and privacy pages carry a real contact address, `taxtrail@vaultvision.team`
  (D-027). Submission is no longer blocked on it.
- Expo `slug` stays `receiptsnap` (D-028). Renaming the project on expo.dev
  changed its display name only; two controlled `usage` runs showed the flip
  breaks `eas build:list`. Developer-facing plumbing, invisible to users.

### v1.0.0 (build 1) · js r9 — 2026-08-10

**Renamed from ReceiptSnap to TaxTrail** (D-026). Not yet published — ships
after PR merge.

- App name, version stamp, paywall copy and every export filename now read
  **TaxTrail**: `taxtrail-2026.csv`, `taxtrail-archive-<stamp>.zip`,
  `taxtrail-diagnostics-<date>.json`, and the `app` field in `backup.json`.
- Bundle identifier **`com.tylerthornbrue.taxtrail`** on iOS and Android.
  Permanent once shipped, and nothing has shipped — this was the window.
  **Requires a new provisioning profile and a build.**
- The on-device database filename is deliberately unchanged, so existing
  receipts survive the rename. Same for the App Store Connect product IDs.

### v1.0.0 (build 1) · js r7 — 2026-08-07

Shipped over the air; no new build.

- **Sales tax parsed correctly on two real-world layouts** (D-020). Bass Pro's
  `$13.98 @ 6.0%` was read as the tax rather than the taxable base; Safeway's
  column layout put an item price next to the `TAX` label. Adds a plausibility
  bound (tax ≤ 25% of total), computes `$X @ Y%` properly, and scans ahead when
  the adjacent amount is implausible.
- **The update-check button is hidden outside dev/preview channels** (D-019), so
  it cannot reach the App Store — a guard rather than a reminder.
- Corpus grown to five receipts from the first diagnostics export.

### v1.0.0 (build 1) · js r6 — 2026-08-06

Shipped over the air; no new build.

- **"Tap to check for updates"** under the version stamp in Summary. A dev
  client pins whichever update was launched from its launcher and does not poll
  the channel, so picking up a new JS revision otherwise means shake -> dev menu
  -> Go home -> select the newest build. This fetches and reloads in one tap.
  Harmless in a production build, where it just forces an early check.

### v1.0.0 (build 1) · js r5 — 2026-08-06

Shipped over the air; no new build.

- **Fixed the category picker overflowing the screen.** All 29 categories
  rendered inline and painted over the notes field and the Save/Discard
  buttons — `maxHeight` on a React Native `View` neither clips nor scrolls
  (D-017). Now a full-screen modal with a scrollable list, the current
  selection marked, and the Schedule C line shown per option.
- Same fix applied to the split-category and saved-receipt-edit pickers, which
  had the same bug; the receipt-edit one had no height bound at all.

### v1.0.0 (build 1) · js r4 — 2026-08-06

Shipped over the air; no new build.

- **Pinch-zoom on receipt photos**, in both the capture review and the saved
  receipt detail. Checking a parse means reading the line items, which a 170px
  thumbnail can't support. Uses iOS ScrollView's native zoom — no new native
  dependency.
- **Parser diagnostics export** — raw Apple Vision output beside what the
  classifier made of it, so a scanning session becomes fixtures in bulk.
- **Classifier scoring harness** (`npm run test:score`) over
  `__tests__/corpus/`. Triage mode needs no expected values; `.expected.json`
  files add hard assertions. Seeded with the three existing fixtures.

### v1.0.0 (build 1) · js r3 — 2026-08-06

Shipped over the air; no new build.

- **VisionKit document scanning** on the camera path. Edge detection,
  perspective correction and contrast enhancement now happen before Apple
  Vision sees the image — the image was always the bottleneck, not the
  recognizer. Falls back to the plain camera if the scanner fails.
- **Multi-page capture**, so long receipts that don't fit one frame parse as a
  single blob. The first page is stored and displayed.
- **Receipt archive export** (`.zip`: images, CSV, backup.json, README) so the
  photographs can leave the device — the prerequisite for treating the app as
  a record of receipts you've thrown away (D-016).
- Decision IDs deduplicated after two sessions collided on D-012/D-013.

### v1.0.0 (build 1) · js r1 — 2026-08-02

First development client. Built and installable.

- Build ID `c0d5ebc3-8439-4333-aaa0-503feab787d2`
- Profile `development` — dev client, ad-hoc internal distribution
- Provisioned to iPhone `00008110-000969302ED3A01E`

An earlier attempt errored at code signing: `expo-notifications` injects the
`aps-environment` entitlement and the provisioning profile predated that module
(D-011). The module was removed and the rebuild succeeded.

Contents:

- Expo SDK 55, RN 0.83, New Architecture, TypeScript, min iOS 15.1
- On-device OCR via `expo-text-extractor` (Apple Vision)
- `classifier.js` and `exporters.js` extracted from PWA v5.5, including the
  Costco FSA and OCR-decimal fixes
- Storage: expo-sqlite; images as JPEGs under documentDirectory
- Merchant and city tax-rate memory via AsyncStorage, Dice-similarity
  fingerprints with a street-number digit gate
- Exports: CSV, XLSX (SheetJS), TXF, QuickBooks CSV
- Custom 3-tab shell, no navigation library
- Bundle ID `com.tylerthornbrue.receiptsnap`
- Native modules: document scanner (VisionKit), camera, local authentication,
  print, haptics, location. `expo-notifications` deliberately excluded — it
  requires the push entitlement and is not needed until the Nov-Dec reminders
  work, which lands alongside the production build's fresh credentials.
- `react-native-document-scanner-plugin` confirmed to compile against RN 0.83
- Permissions: camera, Face ID, photo library, when-in-use location

---

## PWA

### v5.5 — live

Current deployed version, served from `index.html` via GitHub Pages. Includes
the Costco FSA fix and the OCR-decimal fix. The app's `classifier.js` and
`exporters.js` are extracted from this build and must stay in sync with it.

No changes made to the PWA in the 2026-08-01/02 sessions.

---

## Repository

### 2026-08-17

- `.github/workflows/revenuecat.yml` — RevenueCat driver (D-036), `status` and
  `set-bundle-id`. Third service on the same pattern as Cloudflare and Apple
- Records that the `appl_` key already in the repo is the **public SDK key** and
  cannot manage the project; a v2 secret key is a different credential

### 2026-08-21

- **Build 2 submitted to TestFlight** — submission
  `833b2322-d1e7-4395-9a72-d9ebf0c4e614`
- `eas.yml`: `submit` step, gated on `confirm_submit: SUBMIT` like the build
- `eas.json`: iOS submit profile carries `ascAppId` and points at the ASC key
  through `env-string` interpolation. Submit resolves Apple credentials
  differently from build — it does not read the build's env vars
- `asc-check` prints `ascAppId`, so the value comes from Apple rather than a
  dashboard URL

### 2026-08-16

- **App Store Connect API key wired into CI** (D-034). Verified against
  eas-cli 22's shipped code: the Codespace was never required for credentials —
  an ASC API key was. Supersedes D-004
- `eas.yml`: `asc-check` and `asc-bundle-id` steps talk to Apple's REST API
  directly, so the key can be validated and the App ID created **without
  spending a build**
- Apple App ID `com.tylerthornbrue.taxtrail` created; the App Store Connect
  record now carries it

### 2026-08-12

- **`taxtrail.app` is live** — Cloudflare Pages serving `site/`, email routing
  with a catch-all, full DNS. D-033 records the three non-obvious parts:
  attaching a Pages custom domain does not create the DNS record, the project's
  `pages.dev` subdomain is not its project name, and a fresh domain returns 522
  before it settles
- `cloudflare.yml` gained destination-address creation and apex DNS management

### 2026-08-11

- **`taxtrail.app` email DNS is live** — Email Routing enabled on the zone via
  `cloudflare.yml step: email`; MX, SPF and DKIM records confirmed in public DNS
- Cloudflare token preflight rewritten to verify by capability rather than
  against `/user/tokens/verify`, which is user-scoped and always 401s for an
  account-owned token (D-032). A length assertion written from memory was
  removed — it had reported a valid token as malformed
- `status` now prints each endpoint's HTTP code instead of swallowing errors,
  which is what identified the token as zone-scoped

### 2026-08-10 (later)

- `.github/workflows/cloudflare.yml` — Cloudflare driver on the EAS pattern
  (D-031): `status` / `email` / `pages` / `verify`. There is no MCP server for
  Cloudflare DNS, Email Routing or Pages, and the API is reachable, so it runs
  from Actions with a scoped token in repository secrets
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md`: rewrote the Cloudflare procedure against what the dashboard
  actually does — enabling routing on the zone is a separate step from adding a
  destination address, and it is the one that writes the DNS records

- `site/` — the public taxtrail.app site: landing page, privacy policy and
  support page, on `support@taxtrail.app` (D-030). Deployed by Cloudflare Pages
  from that subdirectory, which keeps the retired PWA at the repo root out of it
- D-029: hosting split, and why a custom domain must never go on this repo's
  GitHub Pages — it would move the origin and strand the PWA's stored receipts
- D-030: one support address, via Cloudflare Email Routing
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md`: the one-time Cloudflare procedure, with the 200-check that
  must pass before the app's privacy link is repointed

### 2026-08-10

- `docs/NAMING_2026-08.md` — name shortlist with live-verified conflicts,
  a recommendation, and the clearance procedure Tyler runs
- `docs/CROSS_SURFACE_RULES.md` — the account-wide rule block, so the
  verify-before-recommending rule reaches chat and Cowork, not just Claude Code
- D-024: Control Center / launcher shortcuts — URL scheme now, native
  `ControlWidget` deferred to SDK 56
- D-025: where standing rules live across Claude surfaces
- Barcode scanning confirmed already present in build 1 via `expo-camera`;
  the personal-receipts / returns feature added to the roadmap as JS-only

### 2026-08-02

- `expo-notifications` dropped; `usage` step added to report real build
  consumption from `eas build:list` (#14)
- Documentation set: `README.md`, `STATUS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, PR template
- Native dependencies added and permission surface audited (#12)
- `newArchEnabled` removed — inert under SDK 55, failed schema validation (#11)
- Bundle identifier changed to `com.tylerthornbrue.receiptsnap` (#10)
- Codespace retargeted at the configured `mobile/` project (#9)
- EAS-configured project committed to `mobile/` (#8)
- EAS driver workflow for phone-only operation (#5, fixed in #6 and #7)
- `CLAUDE.md` handoff (#4)
- Installer script, devcontainer, task runner, GTM strategy (#3)
